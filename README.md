1. Installed Jenkins using Docker:
   We set up Jenkins in a Docker container by running a command to pull the Jenkins LTS image and map the necessary ports for web and agent communication. 
2. Created a Simple Jenkins Pipeline:
   We created a basic Jenkins pipeline that included two stages: Build and Test. The pipeline automates the process of building and testing code changes, ensuring that every change is verified and integrated efficiently.
